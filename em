In 2017, the CEO of Equifax had his email account hacked as part of a major data breach that exposed the personal information of millions of people. The hackers were able to gain access to sensitive company data, including customer names, birth dates, and Social Security numbers.

In 2019, the CEO of a UK-based energy firm was targeted in a spear-phishing attack that resulted in the loss of over $240,000. The attackers used information from the company's website and social media profiles to craft a convincing email that appeared to be from the CEO and requested a payment to a fraudulent supplier.

In 2020, the CEO of a major US technology firm had his Twitter account hacked as part of a widespread social engineering attack. The hackers were able to gain access to the CEO's Twitter account and posted messages that appeared to be from the CEO promoting a cryptocurrency scam.

These examples illustrate that even high-level executives can be vulnerable to cyberattacks and social engineering tactics. It is crucial for companies to implement strong security measures and provide regular cybersecurity training to help prevent successful attacks.
